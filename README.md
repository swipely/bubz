Bubz
====

Bubz stubs requests to your web app, so you can test just the client-side code.  Its purpose is to decouple front-end and back-end development.

Use with Cucumber
----

Need to implement a front-end before the back-end is ready?  Use our built-in step definition to stub JSON requests to your Rails app.  Just write your own step definitions to cover the front-end, and you'll have immediate Cucumber coverage for that part of your app.  Then, when the back-end is ready, re-use your front-end step definitions to implement full acceptance tests.

Use Stand-alone

Coming soon.


Why Bubz?
--------

Well, if a "web log" is a blog, then a "web stub" should be a bub, right?
